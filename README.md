# WordGuessGame

This project will involve working with strings, lists, loops, and conditional statements. The game randomly selects a word, and the player needs to guess the letters of that word. It's a fun way to reinforce your understanding of basic Python concepts.

Project Overview:

This program will randomly select a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters of that word. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and it keeps track of the player's progress until the word is completely guessed or a maximum number of attempts is reached.

This Project Helps You Recap Following Python Concepts:

    Classes and Objects: Introduces a simple class (WordGuessGame) to encapsulate the game logic.
    Lists and Strings: Involves working with lists to store guesses and strings to represent the word to guess and the player's progress.
    Random Module: Uses the random module to select a word randomly from a predefined list.
    Loops and Conditionals: Implements a loop to continue the game until the word is guessed or the player runs out of attempts, with conditionals for user input validation and feedback.

    This project allows you to interactively engage with the program, reinforcing your understanding of fundamental Python concepts while creating a fun and interactive game.
